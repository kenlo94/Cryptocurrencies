# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to understand what unsupervised learning is used for by:

1. Processing the data
2. Clustering the data
3. Reducing the dimensions of the data
4. Reducing the principal components of the data using PCA

To do that, we had to:

1. Create a new crypto_df DataFrame
2. Standardize features using the StandardScaler
3. Create a new pcs_df DataFrame
4. Create an elbow curve using hvplot
5. Create a clustered_df DataFrame
6. Create a 3D scatter plot with clusters
7. Create a table with tradeable cryptocurrencies
8. Create a scatter plot using hvplot
